# SHG data fitter


## Description

Second harmonic generation (SHG) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that is often used to evaluate the cristallographic symmetry. The typical signal response of such an experiment will be a flower-like 360 curve with a number of petals related to the corresponding group of symmetry of the probed structure.

In this project, I developed a GUI allowing a semi-automatic fitting process via a general cosinus function. 


  
This program was used to generate the output example above published in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.3c04186

## Installation
To run the files free_plot.py or fitter.py, I recommend to setup a python 3.10 virtual environment and add the required libraires using the following command: *pip install -r requirements.txt* 
<br>
Otherwise and in order to use the executable format, you can download and directly run the files free_plot.exe or fitter.exe on Windows X64 machine. 

## Usage
To use the fitter, you need to provide the experimental data under csv format containing two columns of the angles (in degrees or radians) and the intensity values. Otherwise for the free plot of the general cosinus shape, nothing is needed.
